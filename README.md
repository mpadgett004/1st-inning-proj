# MLB1stInning-Scapper

Created a small web scraper to collect MLB 2021 season 1st inning scores from baseball-reference.com website.

## Setup
Project focused on tracking the 1st inning results of the 2021 MLB season. 

## Process
Using Python and BeautifulSoup, I am able to webscrape baseball-reference.com to collect the first inning data. The script is able to take in new URLs for new game results as the season continues.

VBA ANALYSIS
Once the first inning data is collected and wrote into a Excel file, I am able to write a VBA script to parse through the data to give me a summary of each teams results. In order to not have repetative code, I used a For loop to loop through an array of team names.
